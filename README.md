# Subspace Robust Wasserstein

This repository contains Python code for computing the Subspace Robust Wasserstein Distances defined in

> Paty, Fran√ßois-Pierre, and Marco Cuturi. "Subspace Robust Wasserstein Distances." arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.08949 (2019).

A demo notebook shows how SRW distances can be computed in a simple case. The experiments from the paper can be reproduced using the code in the "Experiments" folder.
